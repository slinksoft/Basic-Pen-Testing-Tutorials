Basic Pen Testing Video Tutorials

I am finally happy to release my basic pen testing videos! I have recreated videos that I've made 3-4 years ago with better quality, better commentating, and smaller file sizes! The goal of these videos is to show you proof of concepts on various attacks and exploits and how you can avoid yourself from being a victim to a professional hacker. Topics include: XSS, Router PSK Cracking, SQL Injection, Shell Uploading, File Inclusion, Sniffing, and much more!

The only videos I need to recreate are my malware development videos. Stay tuned for those! And of course, I will slowly be uploading all my videos to my YouTube channel! Stay tuned and have fun hacking!

NOTE: These videos assume you already have Kali Linux installed. If you have trouble installing Kali Linux, shoot me a email and I'll make a tutorial.

While I do understand this isn't neccesarily a project, it is to me, and I wanted something security related on my portfolio.

My malware development videos will be remade and posted in the future.

All my videos will be uploaded on YouTube slowly in the future.

On a final note, I know it is extremely strange to upload a set of video tutorials on Github, but I wanted this "passion project" (if that's how you put it) to be a part of it. After all, people upload text tutorials, .PDF documents, and textbooks on Github (seriously :D)!
